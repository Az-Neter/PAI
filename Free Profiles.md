Personal AI offers Free Profiles with the capability to create two subprofiles, enabling users to shard their data effectively.

To optimize your experience, its recommended to utilize one subprofile specifically for AI perspective training data, while dedicating the other subprofile solely for personal data.

Here's an example of how you can utilize these subprofiles effectively: When you engage with ChatGPT, request it to "teach me about x topic," and store the resulting output in your AI perspective subprofile. This subprofile becomes a repository of knowledge and insights gathered from AI interactions.

On the other hand, you can utilize the second subprofile exclusively for storing information about your schedule, personal details, and random thoughts. It is important to disable the AI functionality within this subprofile, allowing you to maintain complete control over your personal information without the AI getting in the way.

By using these distinct subprofiles, you can achieve a more unified perspective when interacting with the top-level profile. This top-level profile draws upon both subprofiles, combining the knowledge and insights from your AI perspective subprofile and the personal information from your dedicated subprofile. This integration ensures that you can keep your data separated while maintaining a consistent perspective across different data types.

Base model anchoring refers to the process of establishing and maintaining the overall personality and behavior of an AI system. It involves using a reference point or a "base" to anchor the AI's responses and ensure consistency in its interactions.

In your Personal AI, having a blank subprofile can play a crucial role in base model anchoring. The blank subprofile acts as a foundational template that helps shape the AI's personality and behavior. By leaving this subprofile devoid of any specific data or training, you create a reference point that maintains the AI's default characteristics.

Here's how it works: when you engage with the AI using the other subprofiles, such as the AI perspective subprofile or the personal data subprofile, the AI learns and adapts based on the information stored in those subprofiles. However, the blank subprofile remains unchanged, acting as a grounding point for the AI's overall personality.

By utilizing a blank subprofile, you establish a consistent baseline for the top-level AI's responses and prevent it from being overly influenced or skewed by specific data. This ensures that the AI maintains its core identity and remains aligned with your preferences and intentions.

If you use a paid account with more than two subprofiles, it's highly recommended that you keep one profile entirely blank to act as an anchor.
